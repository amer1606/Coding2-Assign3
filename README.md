ASSIGNMENT 3 SCRAPING

You have to download a website or API data, then make analytics of that and post it on Medium (not obligatory but would be nice) and send me the ipynb file.First, find a project here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f5dAkKW25kDQwYv75oFT3gejdJ3l8F9GTOUx26BqofY/edit?usp=sharing.
You can add your idea, but afterward, please send me four sentences about what you will scrape. Important: you have to choose a different website than you were working on HO1 and HO2.
Option 1: Work with HTML, download all listings (at least 200), add error handling to your function, save your data, and push to GitHub.
Read the data from git, perform data cleaning, transformations, and create at least 5 different plots (you can use plotly or plotnine, or your choice).
Make sure that you also add your findings in text.
Here, an example can be downloading all the yachts for sale. Post your findings, use gist for code embed.
